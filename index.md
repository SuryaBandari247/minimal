## MLOps- With Open Source - Lead Scoring - Sales Domain

CodePro is an EdTech startup that had a phenomenal seed A funding round. It used the money to increase its brand awareness. As the marketing spend increased, it got several leads from different sources. Although it had spent significant money on acquiring customers, it had to be profitable in the long run to sustain the business.

_MLflow and Airflow, popular open-source tools, are utilized to achieve comprehensive MLOps solutions._

> The main objectives of lead scoring are as follows:

* Remove Junk by categorising leads on the basis of propensity to purchase
* Gain insights to streamline lead conversion and address improper targeting

## Semantic Processing (NLP) - Ticket Classification - Finance Domain

For a financial company, customer complaints carry a lot of importance, as they are often an indicator of the shortcomings in their products and services. If these complaints are resolved efficiently in time, they can bring down customer dissatisfaction to a minimum and retain them with stronger loyalty. This also gives them an idea of how to continuously improve their services to attract more customers. 

With the help of **non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)**, an approach under topic modelling, you will detect patterns and recurring words present in each ticket. This can be then used to understand the important features for each cluster of categories. By segregating the clusters, you will be able to identify the topics of the customer complaints.

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/SuryaBandari247/SyntacticProcessing_Healthcare)

‘BeHealthy’ has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. So, companies like ‘BeHealthy’ are providing medical services, prescriptions and online consultations and generating huge data day by day.

_Using a custom build **NER** and **CRF** to get the list of diseases and their treatment from the dataset._

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/SuryaBandari247/DL_RNN_Gesture_Recognition)

A home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

* Thumbs up: Increase the volume
* Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
* Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
* Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
* Stop: Pause the movie

_Tried different combination of models with Conv2D+RNN and Conv3D._
