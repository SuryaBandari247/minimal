[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/SuryaBandari247/MLOps_Lead_Scoring_Open_Source)

CodePro is an EdTech startup that had a phenomenal seed A funding round. It used the money to increase its brand awareness. As the marketing spend increased, it got several leads from different sources. Although it had spent significant money on acquiring customers, it had to be profitable in the long run to sustain the business.

_MLflow and Airflow, popular open-source tools, are utilized to achieve comprehensive MLOps solutions._

> The main objectives of lead scoring are as follows:

* Remove Junk by categorising leads on the basis of propensity to purchase
* Gain insights to streamline lead conversion and address improper targeting

## Telecom Churn - Classical ML model - Telecom Domain

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. 

Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, and build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

It is your job to predict if a customer will churn, given the ~170 columns containing customer behavior, usage patterns, payment patterns, and other features that might be relevant.

_Tried different classical models like **PCA/Random forest /XBboosting**_

## Semantic Processing (NLP) - Ticket Classification - Finance Domain

For a financial company, customer complaints carry a lot of importance, as they are often an indicator of the shortcomings in their products and services. If these complaints are resolved efficiently in time, they can bring down customer dissatisfaction to a minimum and retain them with stronger loyalty. This also gives them an idea of how to continuously improve their services to attract more customers. 

With the help of **non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)**, an approach under topic modelling, you will detect patterns and recurring words present in each ticket. This can be then used to understand the important features for each cluster of categories. By segregating the clusters, you will be able to identify the topics of the customer complaints. 


## Syntactic Processing (NLP) - Identify Treatment - Health domain

‘BeHealthy’ has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. So, companies like ‘BeHealthy’ are providing medical services, prescriptions and online consultations and generating huge data day by day.

_Using a custom build **NER** and **CRF** to get the list of diseases and their treatment from the dataset._


## Gesture Recognition (DL) - RNN/CNN

A home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

* Thumbs up: Increase the volume
* Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
* Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
* Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
* Stop: Pause the movie

_Tried different combination of models with Conv2D+RNN and Conv3D._

## News Recommendation System - NLP - Social Media Domain

Inshort aims to reduce revenue leakage by personalizing user tastes and introducing new content daily on the application's homepage. We will assess these recommendations by tracking user interactions with the content. If a user clicks on a news item, we will recommend similar news items at the bottom of the page to further refine user interests.

The goal is to build a recommendation system that:
1. Recommends the top 10 relevant articles to users at the start of the day.
2. Recommends the top 10 similar articles based on the articles clicked by the user.

_Implement Content based filtering/ Collabrative based and Hybrid models._

## Melanoma_Detection (DL) - CNN - Medical Domain

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. This dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.
